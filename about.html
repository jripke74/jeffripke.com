            <h3>About</h3>
            <p id="about">I live in Spokane, WA with my wife Heidi and two of our kids. I have a third child but he is currently serving in the US Marines. I spend my free time learning to program or
            outdoors working on maintaining our five acres of trees or working in the garden. I also spend allot of time as a
            <a href="http://royalrangers.com/" target="_blank">Royal Ranger Commander</a> with
            our youngest son.</p>
            <p id="about">I am currently in the process of learning to code and currently I am focusing on iOS development. I have been interested in computers since my high school days. My first
            computer system was an Amiga 2500. I love technology and learning about it, it is a big part of my life.</p>
            <p id="about">I have been working in the communications field for the last 18 years, in the Navy and currently at ATT. Working on dozens of different systems both maintaining and operating.
            I have done everything from installing equipment to updating software on dozens of different systems. I also work on networking equipment everything from changing cards to running
            fibers. I also maintain power systems including UPS batteries, ATS (Automatic Transfer Switches), generators and HVAC systems.</p>
